`PillHealth` is a smart medicine box. You **store** medicines, you **schedule** your doses, and you **take** them when it's time to.

PillHealth also provides logs of **what** you've taken and **when** you've taken, so you know whether you're on track with your health management.

The core of PillHealth is the trusty **ESP8266 microcontroller**, which interfaces with a **Supabase** instance via **Arduino**. The Supabase instance data is used by the frontend, which is made using **SvelteKit**
